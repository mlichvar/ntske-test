= ntske-test

`ntske-test` is a tool for testing servers that implement the Key Establishment
protocol of the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp/[Network Time
Security (NTS)] authentication mechanism.

If has a "conformance" mode for testing various corner cases of the protocol
and also a "benchmark" mode for testing the performance of the implementation.

== Requirements

- C compiler
- `make`
- `pkg-config`
- `gnutls` (with development files)

== Usage

```
ntske-test MODE [OPTION]... HOST

Modes:
        -c              Test conformance
        -b              Test performance

Options:
        -p PORT         Set server NTS-KE port (4460)
        -t THREADS      Set number of threads for performance tests (8)
        -m MILLISECONDS Set minimum random delay inserted between I/O (0)
        -M MILLISECONDS Set maximum random delay inserted between I/O (10)
        -d              Print debug messages
        -h              Print this help message
```
